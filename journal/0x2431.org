 - https://youtu.be/WoMibNj7XYM

* Why?
 - need a formidable hobby
 - bored
 - emptiness
 - everything seems just too easy
 - would rather OS Dev than get therapy
* Proc/formats
 - regular post-apocalyptic style updates
 - work logs/journals
 - charting out the landscape
* Frequency
 - 1+/week
* Tooling
 - everything under the sun ..
   - primary drivers :
     - emacs
     - tmux
     - vim
     - GNU/Linux
 - will accumulate a whole bunch of inventory/weaponry along the way
 - will document their integration as separate videos in here
* Opinions
 - overwhelming
 - do not know where to start
 - feels like an open world rpg
 - too many resources/noise : can't yet discern between what's noise and what is signal
 - do not quite know what the end looks like
 - sounds fun
